# MFE App with Vite

This repository contains other two repositories that can work together: A shell or host app and an Todos app that exposes some components that can be used in other applications.

Styling was added using [water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev/)

To run and tests this app follow this steps:

1. Open some terminal on the todo-mfe folder and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build && npm run preview
   ```

   Keep that running

2. In a separate terminal, open the host-app folder and run:
   ```
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
